# Attack is the best defense

`DevOps` `Scripting` `Hacking`

## Addressed topics:

 - Networking
 - Docker
 - Network sniffing (Am a hacker now :smiley:)
 - ARP spoofing (Few defences can now stand my wrath)
 - Dictionary attack (Am something of a linguist now)
 - SMTP via telnet (Nasty business with Base64 was involved)

## Tools used: (now we're talking)

 - Docker (Downloaded a container and... hacked it :smiley:)
 - `ssh` (Too much usage, lost it's novelty by now :wink:)
 - `telnet` (For SMTP connection; this one was hacked)
 - `smtp` (Poorly secured protocal used in legacy systems: hacking toy)
 - `tcpdump` (Network monitoring tool for ethical and unethical uses)
 - `wireshark` (For peering closely at the secrets hidden behind tcpdump's reports)

![NOTE:]
> No animals were harmed during the learning experiences of this project.
> All hacking was done on authorized systems.
